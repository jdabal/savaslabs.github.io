### The position
We are looking to hire an **entry-level marketing coordinator** to support our marketing and business development efforts. The right candidate is both organized and enjoys planning (and are easily excited by spreadsheets and calendars). He or she is also a strong communicator, problem-solver, and self-starter. The position will require **a strong eagerness to learn** as you will be providing assistance with tasks that range from supporting the creation of client proposals and presentations to **coordinating marketing communication calendars and schedules.** The position will also require a certain level of comfort in both online and offline tasks as duties include developing marketing materials such as social posts, newsletters, static assets, videos and blogs, but also hosting and attending a number of events and meet-ups throughout the year. You will work under the mentorship of the executive team and will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. We are **looking to fill this role in [Durham, NC](/durham)**. At Savas you will have a voice in the kind of work you find most rewarding, and we will do what we can to meet your preferences.

### Working at Savas Labs
At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work
with. We like to **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others
 learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference presentations,](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs).
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration.
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We
value **openness**; encourage others to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and seek resources to learn. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat
environment, but instead a supportive one.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance**
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/mission-and-values) seriously.
**We greatly embrace diversity,** value hard work, and use emoji _fairly often_ :+1:. We think you'll like it here.
