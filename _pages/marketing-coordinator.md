 [conference presentations,](/results/open-source/#presentations) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs). We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. We encourage a flexible work schedule so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We value **openness** and encourage our team members to push _and_ recognize the boundaries of their expertise in a given area. We are honest, yet **respectful**; this is not a cut-throat environment, but rather a supportive one. We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance** that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/company/mission-and-values/) seriously. **We greatly embrace diversity,** value hard work, and use emoji _fairly often_ :+1:. You'll like it here.
