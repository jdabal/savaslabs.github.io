### The position
We are looking to add an **intermediate to senior level developer** to our core Savas team. While we fully recognize the term ["full-stack developer"](https://dev.to/remotesynth/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-full-stack-developer-2fp9) is overused and vauge, we are looking for an engineer that has this skillset and **experience in both front-end and back-end frameworks**. Compatibility with our team culture and attitude towards learning and improvement are priority to incoming expert knowledge or any one core technology competency. At Savas Labs we provide peer support and work collectively to achieve our individual and company goals. The position will require proficiency in some form of object oriented programming as well as **strengths in communicating** as you will often interface directly with our clients being a lead technology consultant on select projects. You will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. We are looking to fill the role in [Durham, NC](/durham) but **will consider the right remote candidate.** At Savas you will have a voice in the kind of work you find most rewarding, and we will do what we can to meet your preferences.

### Working at Savas Labs
At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work
with. We like to **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others
 learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference presentations,](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs).
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration.
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We
value **openness**; encourage others to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and seek resources to learn. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat
environment, but instead a supportive one.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance**
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/mission-and-values) seriously.
**We greatly embrace diversity,** value hard work, and use emoji _fairly often_ :+1:. We think you'll like it here.
