### The position
We are looking to add an **entry to mid level digital project manager** to help support our core team. The right candidate collaborates, communicates, and leads effectively both working with internal team members but also with clients. The position will require some technical knowledge for how the web works and **a strong eagerness to learn** even more on the topic as you will play a key leading role on software development projects. Other tasks include **coordinating client and internal communication, calendars, and schedules** and managing budget, timeline, and client expectations from project to project. They love when things get streamlined and more efficient — and enjoy planning and organization (and is easily excited by spreadsheets and calendars). Perhaps above all, this person is a very strong communicator, curious problem-solver, and motivated self-starter. You will work under the mentorship of the executive and operations teams and will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. We are looking to fill the role in [Durham, NC](/durham) but **will consider the right remote candidate.**

### Working at Savas Labs

At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work with. We **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference presentations,](/results/open-source/#presentations) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs). We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration. We encourage a flexible work schedule so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We value **openness** and encourage our team members to push _and_ recognize the boundaries of their expertise in a given area. We are honest, yet **respectful**; this is not a cut-throat environment, but rather a supportive one. We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance** that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/company/mission-and-values/) seriously. **We greatly embrace diversity,** value hard work, and use emoji _fairly often_ :+1:. You'll like it here.
