### The position
We are looking to hire a **junior to mid-level Drupal developer** to add to our core team. You need to have at least some Drupal experience, but compatibility with our team culture and attitude towards learning and
improvement are more important than incoming expert knowledge. The position will require a certain level of proficiency with developing in Drupal as well as **a strong eagerness to learn** as you will work under the mentorship of one of our senior developers. You will work with a **team primarily located in [Durham, NC](/durham)**, though we have a number of team members and supporting contractors that work remotely. We are **looking to fill the role in [Durham, NC](/durham)** but will consider the right remote candidate. At Savas you will have a voice in the kind of work you find most rewarding, and we will do what we can to meet your preferences.

### Working at Savas Labs
At Savas Labs, we prioritize a few things. We like people who are enjoyable to work
with. We like to **learn** from and **teach** one another, and often the result is others
 learn as well either via [blog posts](/blog),
 [conference presentations,](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/total-value-ownership-drupal-8-and-beyond) or [social media](https://twitter.com/savaslabs).
We dedicate time each week for self-improvement, socializing, and collaboration.
We encourage a flexible work schedule
so long as we uphold our commitments to one another and our clients. We
value **openness**; encourage others to be vocal about _not_ knowing something,
and seek resources to learn. We are very honest, yet **very respectful**; this is not a cut-throat
environment, but instead a supportive one.
We take a lot of pride in the quality of our work. We value a work/life **balance**
that keeps us productive and happy. We like to have **fun** and we take [our values](/mission-and-values) seriously.
**We greatly embrace diversity,** value hard work, and use emoji _fairly often_ :+1:. We think you'll like it here.
